# Fun Facts About React
### React couse - Project 1

This is the first of a series of small projects I'm building to learn React. Fun facts about React is a very simple interface built using React components and very simple CSS style.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run

In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm start
```

This will start the local server and open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser
